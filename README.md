a51.li
======

The source code behind my private short url service on http://a51.li and used by various projects including opendata.

This project provides:
* Short url service
* A Memo service similar to twitlonger however it's usually used to publish logs from various batch jobs.
* A simple Twiter bot - currently only tweets
* RabbitMQ support so other applications can generate short urls and generate memo's
